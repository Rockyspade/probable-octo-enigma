User Stories
************

A user story is an informal, natural language description of a software feature, written from the perspective of the end user or other stakeholders. The purpose is to capture ideas about what needs to be built into the application. This will help us define specific features and goals.

Although there's no formality to a user story, the following template is normally useful:

```
As a <role> I want to <goal> so that I <receive benefit>
